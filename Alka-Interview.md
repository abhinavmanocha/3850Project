# Teachers and Technology - An Interview

### By Abhinav Manocha

*Featuring Alka M. - Third grade teacher teaching at a local school in Brampton Ontario*

**Alka is an accomplished teacher who has been teaching for 10 years at the three to five-grade level and she has never had to work online as a teacher. As schools around the world have started to pivot to online classes on a brief notice, there have been many issues, from mental wellbeing to simple internet access to not having essential support to turn to when assistance is needed. In this interview, we will address some of those technological issues in the context of teaching online during the pandemic.**

## How do you use emerging technology to help you combat this pandemic?
In Alka’s words – 
	Our school provides teachers with a couple free licenses to software’s such as “Brightspace”, and “Google classrooms.” The change to online was so quick that it was difficult to adjust to any software adequately without running into major issues that hold me back from teaching to the best of my ability. 

	I have never used google classroom before. I had heard of it but never worked with it. We were provided with no seminar or instruction on how to operate it. It was very confusing indeed. All we were given were instructions on how NOT to go about using google classroom. There were specific instructions given out to us. The most surprising one thus far was: “We are not to call a student by their first name. We must address them by last name and/or student number.” This was very surprising as it made it difficult to operate a classroom. It was never made clear to them why this was the case. She was only told that the privacy of students was important to them. 
    
	Many students forgot many of their usernames and passwords and I had no control over any of their account settings. Consequently, many students were not given a chance to be a part of the online learning experience. In a workplace where learning is done over the internet this was highly inefficient and frustrating.
