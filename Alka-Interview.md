# Teachers and Technology - An Interview

### By Abhinav Manocha

*Featuring Alka M. - Third grade teacher teaching at a local school in Brampton Ontario*

**Alka is an accomplished teacher who has been teaching for 10 years at the three to five-grade level and she has never had to work online as a teacher. As schools around the world have started to pivot to online classes on a brief notice, there have been many issues, from mental wellbeing to simple internet access to not having essential support to turn to when assistance is needed. In this interview, we will address some of those technological issues in the context of teaching online during the pandemic.**

## How do you use emerging technology to help you combat this pandemic?

In Alka’s words:  

Our school provides teachers with a couple free licenses to software’s such as “Brightspace”, and “Google classrooms.” The change to online was so quick that it was difficult to adjust to any software adequately without running into major issues that hold me back from teaching to the best of my ability. 

I have never used google classroom before. I had heard of it but never worked with it. We were provided with no seminar or instruction on how to operate it. It was very confusing indeed. All we were given were instructions on how NOT to go about using google classroom. There were specific instructions given out to us. The most surprising one thus far was: “We are not to call a student by their first name. We must address them by last name and/or student number.” This was very surprising as it made it difficult to operate a classroom. It was never made clear to them why this was the case. She was only told that the privacy of students was important to them. 

Many students forgot many of their usernames and passwords and I had no control over any of their account settings. Consequently, many students were not given a chance to be a part of the online learning experience. In a workplace where learning is done over the internet this was highly inefficient and frustrating. 

## What problems did you face when trying to utilize technology?

It was upsetting how many different programs and software’s the school changed and mandated to use. I was helpless when trying to help the students (grade 3) set up their software that kept changing monthly. Many of the programs that were used were not user friendly, not easy to navigate. When I assigned students homework. Some programs would not allow students to scan and upload pictures to the website. There was no other way to evaluate student work. I can not expect every student to submit PDF’s or files in specific formats when there is no help being provided to the teachers in the first place. Some programs were completely abandoned because they were not Canadian based systems. Such as the program “See Saw.” Students personal information as well as [Alks’s] own information was at risk to being exposed to third party vendors.

This technological model that has been adapted in a short period of time does not consider the IEP (individualized education program) students. They require special guidance and accommodations to help them do the best they can do in school. In a school setting student with IEP’s have assistants that would guide them and help them in any means possible. These sorts of services are not available online. Many of them require resources that “we” as teachers aren’t being provided. This makes it especially difficult to cater to each student learning style. Not everyone learns the same and some students can not learn without a teacher present to help guide them. It is difficult to educate ourselves and the students on these topics with almost no outside help.
