## Issues in Project Management Amid the Pandemic

This is a website designed to shed light on the issues faced in project management throughout COVID-19 and how people could combat that. The website exolores topics such as: 
- Kickstarting remote work culture.
- Understnding how Covid-19 is impacting workers across Industries.
- Choosing the right softwareâ€™s for your business
- As well as a couple of interviews with industry professionals

This was my first exposure to Ruby and Jykell with github pages. I was able to successfully have this site running in less than a week.
